        <div class="cbp-l-inline-desc">As a small business owner, you might be concerned about a cloud service provider storing your data. But the cloud is one of the most secure ways to store information. For example, using cloud software, if your laptop is stolen, no one can access your data unless they have a login to the online account. With cloud software, this is where the data lives, as opposed to on your hard drive. Moreover, your data stays on our cloud servers but you can be anywhere in the world and be able to easily access your data 24x7!</div>
